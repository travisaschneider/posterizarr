    - `basicAuthPassword`: The password for UI authentication. (Default: `posterizarr`)

    #### ApiPart

    - `tvdbapi`: Your TVDB Project API key.
        - If you are a TVDB subscriber, you can append your PIN to the end of your API key in the format `YourApiKey#YourPin`. (It is important to include a `#` between the API key and the PIN.)
    - `tmdbtoken`: Your TMDB API Read Access Token.
    - `FanartTvAPIKey`: Your Fanart personal API key.
    - `PlexToken`: Your Plex token (Leave empty if not applicable).

            - if you prefer textless, do not set plex as fav provider as i cannot query if it has text or not.
            - that beeing said, plex should act as last resort like IMDB does for Movies and not as fav provider.

        - !! IMPORTANT !! -

        Risk of Data Loss from excluded Libraries:

        When you exclude libraries, any assets within these locations may be inadvertently deleted.

        This happens because the script interprets these assets as "not needed anymore" during its execution since they are not found or listed as part of the active scan.

        Ensure that all active asset libraries are included when using that setting on true to prevent unintended deletions.
